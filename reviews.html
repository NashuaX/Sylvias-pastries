  <p>My mother, back when I was visiting California, told me about Sylvia's Pastires and I just had to try it for myself. I ordered the empanadas and was blown away with how crispy the bread was! The meat and other flavors meshed together very well. Now when I got to Cali, I always make it a point to order when I can. </p>

  <p>I always order from Sylvia's Pastries when I host parties! Their sweets are so delicious, I just can't get enough!</p>

  <p>The empanadas are amazing. I've never tasted one that had such a good crust and a hint of sweet insides. I've also tried the macarons and they're pretty nice, I just wish that there was a bigger selection of flavors.</p>

  <p>I like to support small businesses around my area and I have to say, I don't regret trying out Sylvia's Pastries. I ordered some eclairs as well as a dozen empanadas to try out.</p>

  <p>My friend brought some of Sylvia's empanadas while she visited. She said that she asked Sylvia if it was alright if she could order frozen ones so that she could bake it at my place and she gave the okay. I'm sure it would be tastier if I had it freshly made by Sylvia but I have to say, despite baking it myself, it was still very tasty!</p>

  <p>My cousin offered some of the food here while I was visiting for a birthday party. Those chocolate cookies tasted <br>unlike anything I've ever had before. Not too sweet and the outside was crunchy while the inside was soft. </p>
