  <p>My mother, back when I was visiting California, told me about Sylvia's Pastires and I just had to try it for myself. I ordered <br>the empanadas and was blown away with how crispy the bread was! The meat and other flavors meshed together very well. <br>Now when I got to Cali, I always make it a point to order when I can. </p>

  <p>I always order from Sylvia's Pastries when I host parties! Their sweets are so delicious, I just can't get enough!</p>

  <p>The empanadas are amazing. I've never tasted one that had such a good crust and a hint of sweet insides. <br>I've also tried the macarons and they're pretty nice, I just wish that there was a bigger selection of flavors.</p>

  <p>I like to support small businesses around my area and I have to say, I don't regret trying out Sylvia's Pastries.<br> I ordered some eclairs as well as a dozen empanadas to try out.</p>

  <p>My friend brought some of Sylvia's empanadas while she visited. She said that she asked Sylvia if it was alright if she <br>could order frozen ones so that she could bake it at my place and she gave the okay. I'm sure it would be tastier if I had <br>it freshly made by Sylvia but I have to say, despite baking it myself, it was still very tasty!</p>

  <p>My cousin offered some of the food here while I was visiting for a birthday party. Those chocolate cookies tasted <br>unlike anything I've ever had before. Not too sweet and the outside was crunchy while the inside was soft. </p>
